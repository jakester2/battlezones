BattleZones allows for the creation of simple - open PvP arenas where players may enter and leave as they wish, without having to set up lobbies and matches.

BattleZones only enables PvP when a player is within an enabled zone. When the player leaves the zone, they are no longer able to PvP. This plugin offers a very simple way of providing any number of PvP areas to players across multiple worlds.
